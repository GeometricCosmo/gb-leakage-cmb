# 🌌 Relation to Large-Scale Cosmic Rest Frame Anomalies

Recent work has identified a **statistically significant discrepancy** between:

- 🌀 **CMB Dipole Frame**  
- 🌠 **Rest Frame inferred from distant matter tracers** (e.g., quasars and radio galaxies, *Secrest et al. 2025*)

---

## 🔭 Key Insights
- The phenomenology explored here operates at **smaller scales**.  
- It does **not** modify low-ℓ anisotropies or dipole physics.  
- Both results challenge the assumption that gravity and cosmological observables are fully described by a **strictly four dimensional effective framework**.

---

## 📉 Implications
- **High-ℓ power suppression** and  
- **Large-scale frame inconsistencies**  

may be **complementary indications** of small but systematic departures from ΛCDM expectations.  
These could potentially arise from **geometric** or **higher dimensional effects**.

---

## ⚖️ Important Note
We emphasize that:
- ❌ No direct connection is implied between these anomalies.  
- 🧩 The present analysis remains **agnostic** about the origin of large-scale anomalies.
