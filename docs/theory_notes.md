# Theory Notes: Gauss–Bonnet Inspired Leakage Model

## Motivation
Higher–curvature (Gauss–Bonnet) corrections in braneworld scenarios can modify graviton propagation at high comoving wavenumber \(k\). This motivates a smooth ultraviolet suppression of the primordial spectrum, potentially explaining residuals in high–ℓ CMB data.

## Transfer Function
We adopt a phenomenological ansatz:


\[
T(k) = \exp[-2(k/k_c)^p],
\]


applied multiplicatively to the primordial spectrum. The exponent \(p\) is motivated to be near 2 but is allowed to vary in fits.

## Assumptions
- Perturbative regime (\(\alpha k^2 \ll 1\)).
- No light bulk scalars mixing strongly with gravity.
- Brane tension tuned to recover 4D GR at low energies.
- Linear CMB perturbations; standard nonlinear prescriptions for late–time structure.
- Tensor modes remain localized (no anomalous B–modes expected).

## Limits
Mapping from \((k_c, p)\) to fundamental 5D parameters is model dependent. Reported bounds should be interpreted as order–of–magnitude guidance only.

## Observational Tests
- **Achromatic suppression:** frequency–independent across cleaned channels.
- **Polarization signatures:** correlated suppression in TE and EE spectra; absence would falsify the model.
- **No anomalous B–modes:** tensor sector unaffected.

## Forecasts
CMB–S4–like surveys can constrain \(k_c\) with \(\sigma(k_c) \approx 0.05\ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\), providing a decisive test of the preferred parameter region.
