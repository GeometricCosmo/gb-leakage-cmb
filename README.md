# gb-leakage-cmb

A simple, physical fix for the high-ℓ CMB damping and the σ₈/S₈ tension  without new particles.

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.0.0-blue.svg)


This repo adds one smooth, Gauss-Bonnet inspired transfer function T(k) to the primordial power spectrum. It suppresses small-scale power just enough to:
- Remove the ~3σ preference for extra smoothing in Planck/ACT/SPT data
- Lower σ₈ by ~0.07 → brings weak lensing and clusters into agreement
- Keep all the big successes of ΛCDM untouched

## Features
- Drop-in patches for CLASS and CAMB
- Simulate a slice from the early universe, this paper show the smudge is not on the lense but its a feature?
- Ready to run MontePython and Cobaya likelihoods (Big number Math)
- Full chains with Planck 2018 + ACT DR6 + SPT-3G (Or input your own values)
- MIT license → grab it, break it, improve it


Phenomenological Gauss–Bonnet braneworld leakage model for high‑ℓ CMB suppression.  
Includes CAMB/CLASS patches, MCMC scripts, and reproducible pipelines for Planck, ACT DR6, and SPT‑3G data.

## GB Leakage Model for High-ℓ CMB Suppression

This repository provides a reproducible pipeline to test a phenomenological,
Gauss-Bonnet inspired leakage model for high-ℓ CMB power suppression.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeometricCosmo/gb-leakage-cmb.git
cd gb-leakage-cmb
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> ⚠️ Note: You must have [CAMB](https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB) installed with Python bindings.  
> For MCMC fits, install [MontePython](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public) or CosmoMC separately.

### 3. Run validation
Check that the leakage patch reproduces the analytic suppression:
```bash
python validation/test_suppression.py
```

### 4. Generate figures
- Analytic envelope (Appendix):
  ```bash
  python notebooks/validation_quick.py
  ```
- Transfer function \(T(k)\):
  ```bash
  python plots/plot_transfer.py
  ```
- Residual ratio \(C_\ell^{\rm mod}/C_\ell^{\Lambda{\rm CDM}}\):
  ```bash
  python plots/plot_residuals.py
  ```
- ΔS8 scan:
  ```bash
  python analysis/compute_delta_S8.py --p 2.0 --nproc 8 --outdir results
  ```
- Corner plot (from chains):
  ```bash
  python plots/plot_corner.py
  ```

### 5. Run MCMC fits
Toy example (local run):
```bash
python analysis/run_mcmc.py --engine cosmomc --kc 0.75 --p 2.5 --nprocs 4
```

Cluster scan (SLURM array job):
```bash
sbatch cluster/slurm_run_fits.sh
```

### 6. Outputs
- Figures saved in `figures/`
- ΔS8 results in `results/delta_s8_summary.npz`
- Chains in `chains/`
